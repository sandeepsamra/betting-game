Betting Game
============

This game allows a user to enter a bet between $5 and $10 (the user starts with a bankroll of $100), as well as a number between 1 and 10. That number is compared to a randomly generated number, and one of the following events happen:

- if the user's number is equal to the randomly generated number, their bankroll will increase by their bet amount;
- if the user's number is either one less or one more than the randomly generated number, the user's bankroll stays the same; and
- in all other cases, the user's bankroll is decreased by their bet amount.

The game is over when the user's bankroll gets to $0. The user can restart the game at any time.
